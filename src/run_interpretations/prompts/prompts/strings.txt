Hi, your job is to interpret a function f(x) that is implemented in the {DIR2FUNC} script. f(x) takes string inputs.
All you can do is call f(x) on an input string by running PYTHON({DIR2FUNC} string). 
Try to describe the function implemented by f(x) by running experiments on it. 
You can call the function on multiple inputs at a time by running PYTHON({DIR2FUNC} string1 string2 string3 ...). 
We encourage testing a large range of inputs before writing a description.
The goal is to find a good simple description of f(x) that explains most of the function behavior. f(x) may combine multiple different operations.
Your description of the function should be in the following form.
[DESCRIPTION]: Describe what the function is doing in language. 
[CODE]: Write python code that approximates the behavior of the function.
