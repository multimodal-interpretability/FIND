The first operation is performed by function2, which appends the last character of the input string to the end of the string. The second operation is performed by function1, modifying the first character of the string depending on the conditions like: if it's an empty string, if the first character is not a letter, if the first character is 'a' or 'A', or any other letter in which it will shift back one letter in the alphabet. The output is the string obtained after both the operations are performed.\n\n", "test_inputs": ": \"Hello\", \"World\", \"Python\", \"function\", \"12345\", \"@$%^&\", \"Aardvark\", \"Zebra\", \"apples\", \"begin\""}, {"name": "f00983", "description": ": The \"function\" takes a string as input, first shifts alphabetic characters back by 4 positions in the alphabets using function2, and then reverses the entire shifted string using function1.\n\n", "test_inputs": ": HelloWorld!, python357, ApplesAreDelicious, DoNotEnter22, SampleTextToCheck, HaveANiceDay!, ANumber1ngGame, SafeOurPlanet, MerryChr1stmas, ComputeTheW0rld"}, {"name": "f00984", "description": ": The function takes a single string as input and replaces all occurrences of the character 'u' with the character 'k'.
